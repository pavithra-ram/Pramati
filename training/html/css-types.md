# Inline CSS

An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.


# Internal CSS

An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element

# External CSS

An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head section of the HTML page:


An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

Here is how the "styles.css" looks:

body {
    background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
    color: blue;
}
p {
    color: red;
}
