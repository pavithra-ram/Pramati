## Styling HTML with CSS

### Basic knowledge 

CSS stands for  **Cascading Style Sheets**.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of **multiple web pages all at once**.

### CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

* Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
* Internal - by using a style element in the head section
* External - by using an external CSS file

**The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in separate CSS files**. However, here we will use inline and internal styling, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

## CSS Border:
 
The CSS border property defines a **border around an HTML element** --> a box around the text (up & down)

## CSS Padding:

The CSS padding property defines a padding **(space) between the text and the border**

## CSS Margin :

 The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border -- **space between window and border**
