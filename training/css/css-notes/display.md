#The display Property

The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

#Block-level Elements

Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1>-<h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>

#Inline Elements

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>

Block -> one by one 
-----------------------
inline -> side by side
# eg 1:

li {
    display: inline;
}

# eg 2:

h1.hidden {
    visibility: hidden;
}
